    "# Frailty Prediction Project Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The objective of this project is to predict frailty in females based on various attributes like height, weight, age, and grip strength using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stages:\n",
    "The workflow is divided into three stages: Data Preparation, Data Analysis, and Model Development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Preparation Stage:\n",
    "**Objective:** Import the raw data, clean it, and prepare it for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "- Load the data into a suitable data structure (e.g., DataFrame).\n",
    "- Check for any missing or erroneous values and handle them (imputation or removal).\n",
    "- Convert the qualitative \"Frailty\" column (N, Y) to a binary numeric form (0 for N, 1 for Y) if necessary.\n",
    "- Normalize or scale variables like Age, Height, Weight, and Grip Strength, if needed for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Analysis Stage:\n",
    "**Objective:** Analyze the data to identify trends, correlations, or insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables.\n",
    "- Investigate correlations (e.g., between grip strength and frailty, grip strength and age, etc.).\n",
    "- Visualize relationships using plots (scatter plots, histograms, correlation matrices).\n",
    "- Identify significant trends or patterns in the data.\n",

    "**Objective:** Develop a model to predict frailty (binary classification based on the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "- Split the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "- Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) on the training data.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model if necessary.\n",
    "- Save the final model for reproducibility.\n",

    "1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data, making it ready for analysis.\n",

    "3. **Model Development:** Build a predictive model for frailty classification and evaluate its performance.\n",
