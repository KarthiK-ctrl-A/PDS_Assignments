# Frailty Prediction Project Workflow

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict frailty in females based on various attributes like height, weight, age, and grip strength using machine learning.

### Stages:
The workflow is divided into three stages: Data Preparation, Data Analysis, and Model Development.

## 1. Data Preparation Stage:
**Objective:** Import the raw data, clean it, and prepare it for analysis.

### Tasks:
- Load the data into a suitable data structure (e.g., DataFrame).
- Check for any missing or erroneous values and handle them (imputation or removal).
- Convert the qualitative "Frailty" column (N, Y) to a binary numeric form (0 for N, 1 for Y) if necessary.
- Normalize or scale variables like Age, Height, Weight, and Grip Strength, if needed for later analysis.

### Folder Structure:
```
data/
├── raw_data/
│   └── frailty_data.csv      # Raw data file
├── cleaned_data/
│   └── cleaned_frailty_data.csv  # Data cleaned and preprocessed for analysis
└── scripts/
    └── data_preparation.py  # Python script for cleaning and preprocessing
```

## 2. Data Analysis Stage:
**Objective:** Analyze the data to identify trends, correlations, or insights.

### Tasks:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables.
- Investigate correlations (e.g., between grip strength and frailty, grip strength and age, etc.).
- Visualize relationships using plots (scatter plots, histograms, correlation matrices).
- Identify significant trends or patterns in the data.

### Folder Structure:
```

├── eda_plots/
│   ├── scatter_grip_age.png   # Scatter plot of grip strength vs. age
│   └── grip_frailty_corr.png  # Correlation plot for grip strength vs. frailty
├── analysis_results/
│   └── correlation_matrix.csv # Correlation results in CSV format
└── scripts/
    └── data_analysis.py  # Python script for EDA and correlation analysis
```

## 3. Model Development Stage:
**Objective:** Develop a model to predict frailty (binary classification based on the data).

### Tasks:
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
- Fine-tune the model if necessary.
- Save the final model for reproducibility.

### Folder Structure:
```
model/
├── trained_model/
│   └── frailty_predictor_model.pkl  # Trained machine learning model
├── evaluation_metrics/
│   └── model_performance.csv  # Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
└── scripts/
    └── model_training.py  # Python script for model development and evaluation
```

## Steps Overview:
1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data, making it ready for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory analysis to understand relationships and trends in the data.
3. **Model Development:** Build a predictive model for frailty classification and evaluate its performance.

Each stage should have its respective Python scripts and outputs saved in organized directories to maintain reproducibility and clarity.
